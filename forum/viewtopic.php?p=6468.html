<div class="content">Heya all readers.<br/><br/>We really want to go deeper with our website and explore the opportunities it has. Especially we would want to know in what ways we could improve and make the site more interesting to readers. So we are looking for feedback on <span style="font-weight: bold">what you think is missing from this website</span>. You can of course mention the stuff you love and check daily, but mostly we are looking for the stuff that is not there yet (and should be).<br/><br/>All kind of comments are welcome, for instance: &quot;I want more boss strategy content&quot;, &quot;I want more blogs from Iiris&quot; or &quot;I would like to have feature x on the frontpage.&quot;<br/><br/>This feedback is very significant to us - we really want to hear your opinion and we try to change how things go around here.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks in advance<br/><br/>xenophics</div>

<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Existing content:</span><br/><br/>Deepen the information available on each member since people like to know the persons behind the chars as good as possible. Obviously w/o invading their privacy too much. I like the WoW timeline write-ups some members have done in their profiles. Other possibilities are of course picture(s) &amp; personal information.<br/><br/>Expand the current galleries and maybe tweak the navigation to have more galleries on one page for better overview. The galleries of Zin and Xeno are large and have a description for almost every picture, which I enjoy a lot as it puts the picture in perspective. <br/><br/>More articles are always welcome I suppose, no matter if they are guides (class, strategies or even leveling), write-ups (LANs, real life meetings) or other stuff that members can think of and would like to share.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">New content:</span><br/><br/>Expanding the streaming idea as people love nothing more than watching their &quot;heroes&quot; raid the hardest content / newest content and kick some ass. The more &quot;professional&quot; you'd want to offer this, the more you would have to look for the infrastructure in terms of internet connection speed, streaming page etc.. I suppose.<br/><br/>As we know people come here mainly to ask questions related to their class and how to improve is. So writing guides would be a possibility. I was never a big fan of the Ensidia page but I have to say I liked the guides that some of their members put out. So maybe that is an option for Paragon too. It is nothing fancy or new, but a good and rock solid guide is worth a lot imo. <br/><br/>If that idea is not appealing because members don't feel like explaining everything you could also try to make a collection of the most commonly asked questions on the board and collect the answers. Quite some work digging through the threads but it might lead to a nice comprehensive collection of FAQs. <br/><br/>Collect all the audio, video and textual interviews that were done with members of Paragon on the page and create a section that links them all or even safe them on the page too in order to preserve them. <br/><br/>Create a chart of when and how the various members of Paragon started to join into Paragon or the guilds that led to its creation. Would be fun to have an overview to see who played together with whom before and where etc...<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">For Cataclysm:</span><br/><br/>The release of Cataclysm of course offers a ton of opportunities to release interesting content. Document your journeys while leveling as good as possible, whether it is streams (with or without commentary) or galleries. It is of course clear that you'll rush to 85 as fast as possible, but maybe some time can be spared.<br/><br/>Those journeys can also be well documented in blogs which would surely find a lot of readers. But again, you need to have the time to do it of course :) <br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic">On a personal note: Please please do not try to turn this page into a community hub like so many other guilds have tried before. Keep this as a small and nice guild site that revolves around the guild only. Don't promise giant things that in the end can't be kept because the members of a guild are mainly here to play the game, not to become editors for website content. Just release stuff when you have the time for it and when it is done properly. People will appreciate it and I'd rather have a surprise to see new content than waiting for the awesome content that was promised or that is supposed to come out each week.</span></div>

<div class="content">Thanks again Niroth for all the effort you put into writing the feedback (as always).<br/><br/>You have been heard and we'll try our best to take the best out of your ideas and suggestions. I just wanted to answer you and let you know that we have made a profounding decision about this site long time ago. We will never go community (tho someday we might have more contributors than guild members only), but the site will always revolve around Paragon, who we are and what we are doing. If people want a community site there is already plenty to select from.</div>

<div class="content">Hey! I've been a long time reader and fan of you guys. Been watching the race for LK HM with Ensidia as a kid watches the playoff race in hockey. (I'm from Canada)<br/><br/>I'm not perfect in english so sorry for mistakes, if I do some.<br/><br/>As I've watched all your news on your websites, I had a lot of favorites. I loved the article about Tuutiz for his Shadowmourne (I just liked the &quot;interview&quot; article.), and also the interview a guy did in forums (can't remember his name), but the main idea how succesful you could be apart from being awesome players (full finnish, small niche, etc), and last, the LK video(s) are just awesome. That's my feedback.<br/><br/>For my &quot;suggestions&quot; I'd really love to see more &quot;guides&quot;, you know, like the one anaram did. I've been reading the your forums a lot and about 50% if not more, are &quot;my dps are low, help me&quot; or &quot;what should I do with this or that&quot;, people love to refer themselves to &quot;better&quot; people, just because if you want to be the best, you have to learn from the best.<br/><br/>Finally, on a personal note, as an Enhancement shaman myself, I'd love to see Rihmz more :) I've seen him talk 3-4 times in forums and his interventions were always relevant.<br/><br/>Oh and also, people seem to love Xeno a bit too much, you should post more pictures!

<div class="content">Many useful tips can be found as answers to specific questions and would probably not make it into a general guide, so something like a &quot;blue post&quot; feature would be nice, so you can find posts made by paragon member easier. <br/>For example:<br/>- mark threads which contain posts by paragon member<br/>- create a button &quot;jump to next paragon post&quot;<br/>- overview about the last 5 paragon posts (like the &quot;last news&quot; or &quot;last comments&quot; box)</div>

<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Zaret wrote:</cite>Without the community aspect to the site in can be difficult to drag people in, however if the site was a little more easy on the eyes, that would be nice. </div></blockquote><br/><br/>The site has so far dragged in a lot of people w/o being a community oriented website. So it also works without. The easiest example from the other side is Ensidia which I think did not work out as they expected. Content came slow, promised content had huge delays often or was not done at all. User-generated blogs were the majority of blogs written there, which frankly I don't care much about. So for me it boiled down to reading the guides and occasional member blog posts / interviews. <br/><br/>For that I need no community page with the idea of connecting everyone. This page shows that it works fine by having a board to ask questions and member generated content. No need for fancy profiles, friends lists, user galleries, etc. <br/><br/>If I come here I want to read about Paragon and its members, now about the other people who have come here for the same reason. <br/><br/>But maybe that is just me :)</div>

Similar to Paragon. Low profile. Great success.</div></blockquote><br/><br/>Totally agree. <br/><br/>Back on topic. <br/><br/>I agree with the community aspect not being necessary for pulling people in, however, it is going to limit the numbers. I think that Paragon could work were Ensidia fizzled out because of their attitude. Their blogs are 90% negative and about who they hate and why they hate them.<br/><br/>Actually back on topic this time.<br/><br/>Member articles, as another poster had previously said, would be nice to read, even if they have no point, after all the people who browse your site are drawn by the success of the members. Would that be too community-esque?</div>
