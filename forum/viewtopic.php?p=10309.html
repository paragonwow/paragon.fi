<div class="content">Just a quick (I hope) question about the 'new'/ revamped restoration tree. <br/><br/>I have come close to bashing my head into the wall with choosing what points I want to spend in what talents. However, there are some talents that (to me) have about the same priority level after the main 'must haves' are already accounted for. With the new Nature's Bounty increasing the haste of the cast of Nourish by 10/20/30% per Rejuv on 3 or more targets, I'm not entirely certain Naturalist is worth it any more. Also, the cost of most heals have been reduced, so while Moonglow would be quite nice to max out, 3/3 of Genesis may or may not be a wiser choice. I'm probably missing something here, though.<br/><br/>In the end, this is what I ended up with.  <a class="postlink" href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/duskwood/capricieux/talent/secondary">http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/d ... /secondary</a>  (may or may not be updated)<br/><br/>Looks like I'll have to gem/enchant Mastery and Spirit with this build though. (Mana abuser) And rely on getting Intellect from gear and whatnot.<br/><br/>I suppose the question is, &quot;What is your opinion on the changes?&quot;.<br/><br/>Also, thank you in advance if you respond, it's greatly appreciated :)<br/><br/>Edit: The talent isn't 'per', it's 3 or more targets affected by Rejuv. That's what I get for alt-tabbing between this and a H-GB achievement run I suppose.</div>

<div class="content">Sorry for the late response, Assembly Winter held me busy and out of the class forums!<br/><br/>I think it's an interesting idea to drop Naturalist. I think you could get away with dropping that and the other Nourish/HT talents on certain kinds of 25-man encounters, where you can just focus on raid healing. I wouldn't run with this as an exclusive spec, but something like this could work for steady raid healing if you plan on running with two resto specs for next tier.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/talent#0hbbZZrckIbcMu0uo" class="postlink">http://www.wowhead.com/talent#0hbbZZrckIbcMu0uo</a><br/><br/>That leaves 3 points to distribute between Genesis, Moonglow, and Furor.<br/><br/>You don't want to take only 2/3 HotW because 2% int is very good. On the other hand, there's not that much benefit in taking Empowered Touch if you skip Naturalist. This kind of talent build would only be spamming WG + Rejuv, with a manual LB refresh every ~10 seconds.<br/><br/>If you have to do any tank healing (10s...) or resort to Nourish / HT at all, I'd still pick Naturalist and Empowered Touch. Just an interesting idea for any aura damage fights the next tier might bring.</div>

<div class="content">I have a question about reforging and my specs. WIth the reforging, Im currently running only 10m raids and with my guild were using resto druid/holy pally/holy priest for our 3 heals. Should I be reforging to haste or focus towards spr/mastery more. Mana issues dont happen as often now that im getting better gear, Im just trying to find the best setup to improve my healing so that my other healing partners can save some of their mana and possibly eliminate them going oom possibly a little bit less than they do now. The only tank healing I do is keeping my LB on the off tank for my clearcasting proc and healing the OT when they are going to be taking huge dmg because our holy priest doesnt have the mana pool or regen to keep up with my resto druid right now. Just wanted to see what your view point was on the haste/mastery for raid healing right now. <br/><br/>As for the spec, these are the 2 im running with right now. Primary is mainly for heroics but is occasionally used in raids, Secondary spec is the main one im working on for my raid healing. Just wanted to see if you had any suggestions to try something different to improve my healing.<br/><br/> <a class="postlink" href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/lightbringer/all%C3%A1r%C3%A1n/talent/primary">http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/l ... nt/primary</a> <br/> <a class="postlink" href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/lightbringer/all%C3%A1r%C3%A1n/talent/secondary">http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/l ... /secondary</a> <br/><br/>Thanks again for any help or suggestions you can give, look forward to seeing more of the superb job you guys do with the end game content.</div>

<div class="content">I hear Assembly went well for you guys :) Didn't get to watch the raid, though :( But I do appreciate your post, seeing the picture from a different angle is refreshing.<br/><br/>That build is certainly something to chew on, although if I need to I would take points out of HotW. It is nice to have the resource to heal, but if it's not backed up by some way of internally replenishing said resource without using cd's, it usually doesn't end well. At least, that's my theory. I'm probably sitting in the wrong pew (again).<br/><br/>I was actually messing around with another build that didn't have Efflorescence in it, the idea being gotten from a post in the healing forums from the WoW site... it is a weird idea, yes, being how druids are mainly aoe healers (we need another Trauma implemented somewhere down the line :D) but it freed up 3 points that could go in other talents, and if Swiftmend isn't hitting for too much anyways it seems to be a gain. Not quite certain it would fly in 10 mans or instances where aoe damage is obscene... And who doesn't like pretty green circles?<br/><br/>I don't know how to explain the 2/3 HotW and my current build without an explanation:<br/>It was actually yesterday I pugged into a BH run, and 2 healed it with a fellow resto druid who... Well, they certainly did better than I thought they would with their gear/talent choices. I have to mention this only because it kind of affected how I had to go about healing. In short, I found out that Remove Corruption (talented) isn't affected by Moonglow, and somehow I thought it did. 29/30 dispells went out, and I used Regrowth both with and without Clearcasting, primarily on the tank I had Lifebloom stacked on when they were below 40%. (On top of the usual Rejuv/WG when it's bad/Tree form and Tranquility when it's ugly and spam stacks of LB on lowest health individuals) But it's ok! We got him!<br/><br/>I really haven't used Nourish since... when did they change it? I tried forcing myself to use it when I first made the build, but it felt too much like I was healing on my paladin.<br/><br/>I find that I'm using Regrowth more often than not on players when they are at or below 35-40%, even if clearcasting isn't up. I don't know if it's a bug or if it's meant to be, but with the glyph it keeps refreshing itself until said target reaches 50%. That's really the only 'mana chewer' I'm using, and with the glyph + 3/3 Moonglow + Empowered Touch + Nature's Bounty I feel like I'm 'getting the most for my money'.<br/><br/>As a side note I would just like to mention how much I love the effect of Mandala + Innervate. Also, it would be nice if Clearcasting could stack, I find it really annoying that it seems to proc onerightafteranother every so often and quite frankly I can't cast that fast.<br/><br/>Edit (I'm bad with these):  <a class="postlink" href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2089199759">http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2089199759</a> , Carthias' opinion was what had me curious.</div>

<div class="content">@Allárán<br/><br/>For 10-man, I'd definitely favor mastery over haste, simply because you'll have more opportunities to leverage mastery with WG + Rejuv. You should either aim for the Rejuv or WG breakpoint with haste, and spend the rest on mastery. The exact amount of rating needed depends on what buffs you have available; I only remember the WG breakpoint without DI at 2004 rating off the top of my head, but you should be able to find values that concern you in the resto thread at EJ (<a href="http://elitistjerks.com/f73/t110354-%5Bresto%5D_cataclysm_release_updated_4_0_6_a/" class="postlink">http://elitistjerks.com/f73/t110354-%5Bresto%5D_cataclysm_release_updated_4_0_6_a/</a>).<br/><br/>Oh, and for most real scenarios, 3/3 Moonglow 2/3 Furor is better than the other way around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>@Capricieux<br/><br/>Do note that the 2% intellect HotW gives you is not just mana. It's also spell power (and a marginal amount of crit). I have almost 5500 intellect unbuffed, so it's no small amount, and certainly better than a point in eg. Blessing of the Grove.<br/><br/>When playing with the talent calculator, I was contemplating on dropping Efflorescence from the sample spec as well. The problem is that the points you free up there can only be used for utility or (re-)grabbing Naturalist and Empowered Touch. The whole point for me was to make a spec without either. Efflorescence itself is ok in 25-man, though it's certainly overbudgeted (or underbudgeted?) at 6 talent points. If you look at your logs and find that you're getting little use out of it in 10-mans, it could be worthwhile to simply spend the points elsewhere. Do look at how much you actually heal with it though, before jumping into conclusions.</div>

<div class="content">Thanks for the advice Xaar. I adjusted the furor and moonglow, noticed a big difference there. Also dropped my haste down to hit the haste breakpoint for Rejuv with DI. So far I have noticed a major difference in the healing. Also noticed im not losing as much mana cause I think honestly im not casting as much. I'll be able to really know if its better tonight once i go to BWD with my guild but once again, thanks for the advice.</div>

<div class="content">The advice is certainly appreciated, Xaar; I've tweaked my talent tree a bit, and noticed a smallish increase in overall healing effectiveness from a few test runs in the dungeon finder. <br/><br/>I do apologize for being a bit of a stubborn P.I.T.A. I appreciate the time you took to read through and answer/explain these things. :)</div>
